# PREDICTING-HIRING-DECISIONS-IN-RECRUITMENT-DATA
Introduction:

This project aims to enhance the recruitment process by providing a predictive tool that helps recruiters identify promising candidates more efficiently. By leveraging logistic regression, we can gain valuable insights into the hiring process and contribute to more effective talent acquisition strategies.
The primary objectives of this project include:

Data Collection and Preparation: Aggregating and preprocessing recruitment data to ensure it is suitable for analysis. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.

Feature Selection: Identifying the most relevant features that influence hiring decisions. These may include candidate qualifications, work experience, skills, and recruiter interactions.

Model Training: Developing a logistic regression model using the prepared dataset. This involves splitting the data into training and test sets, fitting the model to the training data, and tuning hyperparameters to optimize performance.

Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's accuracy and performance using metrics such as accuracy score. This step ensures the model's predictions are reliable and useful for practical applications.

Insights : Interpreting the results to provide actionable insights for recruiters. By understanding the factors that significantly impact hiring decisions, organizations can refine their recruitment strategies and make data-driven decisions.
